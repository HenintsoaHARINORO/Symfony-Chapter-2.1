# Stellar Development with Symfony 4

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script
for the [Stellar Development with Symfony 4](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony4) course on KnpUniversity.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`

Have fun!

## Somebody Has To

Somebody has to go polish the stars,
They're looking a little bit dull.
Somebody has to go polish the stars,
For the eagles and starlings and gulls
Have all been complaining they're tarnished and worn,
They say they want new ones we cannot afford.
So please get your rags
And your polishing jars,
Somebody has to go polish the stars.
